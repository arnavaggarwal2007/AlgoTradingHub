source venv/bin/activate
python rajat_alpha_v67_dual.py


ip: 18.191.18.207

go to the download folder
ssh -i "aws-key.pem" ubuntu@18.191.18.207




Windows Users (easiest way):
Open PowerShell.

Navigate to your Downloads folder: cd Downloads

Run this command (replace 1.2.3.4 with your EC2 Public IPv4 address found in the AWS console):

PowerShell

ssh -i "aws-key.pem" ubuntu@1.2.3.4
(Type yes if asked about fingerprints).

Mac/Linux Users:
Open Terminal.

Run: chmod 400 ~/Downloads/aws-key.pem (Protects the key).

Run: ssh -i ~/Downloads/aws-key.pem ubuntu@1.2.3.4

4. Part C: The "Copy-Paste" Command List
Once you see the ubuntu@ip-172-xx-xx-xx:~$ prompt, you are inside the AWS cloud computer. Run these blocks one by one.

Step 1: Install Python and Tools
Copy this entire block and paste it into the terminal (Right-click to paste in PowerShell/Terminal).

Bash

# 1. Update the server software
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# 2. Install Python pip (package manager)
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv -y

# 3. Create a clean folder for your bot
mkdir trading_bot
cd trading_bot

# 4. Create a virtual environment (Good practice!)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 5. Install the trading libraries
pip install alpaca-py pandas pandas_ta pytz schedule


Step 2: Create Your Files (The "Nano" Method)
Since setting up file transfer tools (SFTP) can be annoying, we will just create the files directly on the server.

A. Create config.json

Type: nano config.json

Paste your Configuration JSON content (from your local computer).

Save: Press Ctrl + O, then Enter.

Exit: Press Ctrl + X.


5. Part D: Run it Forever (The "Screen" Trick)
If you just type python alpha_bot.py, the bot will die the moment you close PowerShell. We use a tool called screen to keep it running in the background.

Start a new screen session:

Bash

screen -S my_bot
(The screen will clear. You are now in a "virtual" terminal.)

Activate your environment and run the bot:

Detach (The Magic Move):

Press Ctrl + A, let go, then press D.

You will see [detached] and return to the main command line.

Your bot is now running in the background! You can safely close PowerShell/Terminal.

How to check on your bot later:
Log back into AWS via SSH and type:

Bash

screen -r my_bot
(This brings the bot back to your screen so you can see the logs or stop it).
